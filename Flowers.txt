Flowers are the reproductive structures of flowering plants. 
The main function of flowers is sexual reproduction. 
Sexual reproduction in flowering plants occurs through fertilisation. 
Fertilisation is the key step in sexual reproduction. 
Pollination occurs before fertilisation. 
After fertilisation, seeds are formed. 
The flower later develops into a fruit that protects the seeds.
